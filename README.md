# ISRO-Design-and-control-of-a-Stewart-platform
Complete development, testing and integration of a stewart platform for mirrors of space telescopes.

I worked at ISRO for a year during my senior summer and my senior year of college. I designed a custom dual-motion actuator capable of nanometric movements during the summer. After the fabrication and assembly of 6 more actuators, I worked on controlling the assembled Stewart platform (a type of parallel manipulator) as a part (mirrors) of an upcoming space telescope to be launched by the Indian Space Research Organization. My main contributions to the project over the course of the year were designing the actuator itself and assembling it and writing control models integrated with sensors mounted on the platform for 5 degrees of freedom (except yaw movement) on the platform.

Since this project is a government project, I am not obliged to share the development codes and research papers with the public. I have attached the reports of my summer and college work in this repo along with the certificates of project completion after the research internship.
